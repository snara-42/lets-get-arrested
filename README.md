# Lets-get-arrested project

In Japan, some schoolgirls were caught by the Hyogo pref police for writing an endeless loop of aleart in JavaScript like this:

        for (;;) {
          aleart("!");
        }

So this is regarded as a "crime" in Japan. Why don't we be criminals and get arrested (or not...)?

Enjoy criminal life!
